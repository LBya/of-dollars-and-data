# Of-Dollars-And-Data
Repo for ofdollarsanddata.com blog

The numbering of files is consistent across the import, build, and analysis folders.  I did this in order to make it easier to track down how data gets into the system (import), how it gets cleaned up (build), and how I visualize or quantify it (analysis).

The numbering should also reflect my blog posts accurately as well.
