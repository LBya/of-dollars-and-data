# Of-Dollars-And-Data
Repo for OfDollarsAndData.com blog

The numbering of files is consistent with the blog post on the website.  The post number is at the bottom of each post.  The number is also the same across the import, build, and analysis folders.  I did this in order to make it easier to track down how data gets into the system (import), how it gets cleaned up (build), and how I visualize or quantify it (analysis).
